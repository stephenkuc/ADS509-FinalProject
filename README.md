# ADS509-FinalProject
Repo for Final Project in ADS509

This project is focused on text-mining with utilizing the Twitter API to pull data from twitter. 

We are utilizing tweets focused on Vaping, and we're trying to understand the sentiment around Vaping as well as topics people are talking about. With the high rate of vaping, especially among young Americans, we are interested to see if there are ways we can understand what is drawing them to vape, as well as how companies can target their anti-vaping ads.
